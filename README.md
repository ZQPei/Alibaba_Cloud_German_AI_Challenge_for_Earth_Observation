## Introduction

This competition is an Alibaba Cloud German AI Challenge aimed for Earth Observation. [Click Here to see detailed information.](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231683/introduction?spm=5176.12281957.0.0.38b076d83CIYGw)

According to the United Nations, 68% of the worldâ€™s population is expected to live in urban areas by 2050. As cities around the world try to accommodate this enormous influx, urban planners and logisticians are faced with monumental challenges to ensure the benefits of urbanization are realized by all. With the boundaries of big data technology being expanded, the successful management of urban growth can now be assisted by the consolidation of large volumes of sensor data collected by Earth observation satellites.

In the latest Tianchi competition, contestants will try to address the urbanization challenges by using datasets of several million matched image patches from European Earth observation satellites Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. The datasets will include radar and multispectral sensor data, covering 42 cities. The goal of the competition is to classify the data into 17 so called local climate zones, which will help to identify solutions for urban planners. For example, the data could potentially be used for quantifying urban heat island magnitude or mapping urban terrain.
